  <h1>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h1>
  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable
    rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice
    and peace in the world,<br>
    Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
    acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world
    in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom
    from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common
    people,<br>
    Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last
    resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be
    protected by the rule of law,<br>
    Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between
    nations,<br>
    Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their
    faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person
    and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote
    social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,<br>
    Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation
    with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of
    human rights and fundamental freedoms,<br>
    Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the
    greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,<br>
    Now, therefore,<br>
    The General Assembly,<br>
    Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of
    achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and
    every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by
    teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by
    progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and
    effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States
    themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.</p>
