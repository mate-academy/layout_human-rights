# Human rights

Transform the preamble and the first 16 articles of the following document into 
a web page: https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf

The font of the page must be `Arial`. Set the base font size to `13px`.

The "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" must be a `h1` heading, styled as 
`17px bold`.

The "Preamble" and "Article N" must be `h2` headings, styled as `15px non-bold`.

The vertical spacing around "Preamble" and "Article N" must be `1em`. All other 
vertical spacing must be set to zero, as in the document.

Every paragraph should go into a `<p>` tag (the preamble is supposed to be a 
single paragraph divided with `<br>` when necessary).

Put numbered lists into `<ol>`s.

After article 16 don’t display any more articles, but put an `h2` heading reading 
"Articles 17 to 30" instead and make it a `link` pointing to the PDF version of 
the document. Style the link to always be `green`.
